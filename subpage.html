            <dt>Barometer</dt>
            <dd>An instrument that measures atmospheric pressure. It is used in weather forecasting and to measure altitude.</dd>

            <dt>Cloud cover</dt>
            <dd>A measure of the percentage of the sky covered by clouds at a given time.</dd>

            <dt>Dew point</dt>
            <dd>The temperature at which the air becomes saturated with water vapor, causing the water vapor to condense into dew or frost.</dd>

            <dt>Humidity</dt>
            <dd>A measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, expressed as a percentage of the maximum amount of water vapor the air can hold at a given temperature.</dd>

            <dt>Precipitation</dt>
            <dd>Any form of water, such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail, that falls from the atmosphere to the Earth's surface.</dd>

            <dt>Pressure gradient</dt>
            <dd>The rate at which atmospheric pressure changes over a horizontal distance. A strong pressure gradient indicates a steep change in pressure, which can lead to strong winds.</dd>

            <dt>Wind chill</dt>
            <dd>A measure of the cooling effect of wind on the human body, taking into account both the air temperature and the wind speed. The wind chill index indicates the apparent temperature, or how cold it feels to exposed skin.</dd>
